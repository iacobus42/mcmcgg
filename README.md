mcmcgg
======

A collection of simple, documented functions for the visualization of mcmc 
output, specifically using CODA objects resulting from OpenBUGS/WinBUGS 
mcmc chains. 

How to use
----------

Either browse to `mcmcgg/R` and use the functions from there or download the 
file `mcmcgg_1.0.tar.gz` and install in R using `install.packages("~/path/to/mcmcgg_1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")` at the R console. 

The vignette for the package has a complete worked example. Additionally, 
the help for any of the functions in the package (such as `history.gg()`)
contains a link to the other major functions in the package. How to use 
each function is documented on the respective man pages. Examples are 
included on both the function man pages as well as on the package man 
page.
